![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa337c03-9cac-4f73-b19b-b6b65e53a81d)

 A compilation of big data cleaning and transformation projects performed using PySpark for preparation towards analytics consumption covering the following domains of analytics: Sports, e-commerce, and object detection; demonstrating essential data engineering skills such as data cleaning, data transformation, feature engineering, in preparation for insights reporting and model building using the cleansed data.

For starters:

 1. [Read here](https://sparkbyexamples.com/pyspark-tutorial/) on why PySpark is currently among the most essential tools used by data engineers in handling big data through its distributed computing model as a replacement of traditional computing.
 2. [Install PySpark here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/install.html) OR refer to the DataCamp tutorial [here](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/installation-of-pyspark). ALternatively, you may [clone this repository by jplane](https://github.com/jplane/pyspark-devcontainer?tab=readme-ov-file) to obtain a VS Code devcontainer setup for local PySpark development (1-node cluster) environment.
